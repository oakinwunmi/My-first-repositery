<h1>Motion</h1>

<h2>What is motion</h2>
    
    <p>Motion is when something moves.Pushing and pulling makes <strong>motion</strong>.
For example,I push the table.Pushing makes things go forwards,I pull the table.Pulling makes thing go backwards.<strong>Gravity</strong> is also motion because it pushes things down</p>

<h3>Forces</h3>

<p>There are special forces that make motion work like gravity.<strong> For example,Gravity pushes down the cup on the paper but the paper pushes up on the cup.Because of that the cup does not move. This means that the forces are balanced. Objects are balanced when both forces are pushing the same amount of power but unbalanced forces are when the forces move an object this mean one force is strong and one force is weak if an object is unbalanced</strong></p>

<h3>What stops motion?<h3>

    <p>There is a force called <strong>Friction</strong>that can stop motion.Friction occurs when two sides slide past each other.The force of friction opposes the motion of an object, causing moving objects to lose energy and slow down.For example, When you are on the swing you are going fast at first but after some time you will slow down untill a person pushes the swing.But friction can not stop motin in a water slide because the water takes away some of the motion.<p>
